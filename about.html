            TEDx is a unique gathering where TED-like talks and performances are shared with the community aimed at unleashing new ideas and inspirations. Some of the world's leading thinkers, who have dreamt of game-changing ideas, are invited to share their stories. 

The 'x' in TEDx stands for an independently organized TED event. It mainly comprises speakers who bring in thought-provoking ideas, complete with enough professionalism and zeal, to leave you with an impression of enough powerful ideas and insights. The speakers are mainly passionate individuals looking to spark discussions and conversations by bringing forward thoughts and research ideas in their areas of expertise.

        <p>With the ever-shifting boundaries of societal acceptance in every aspect of life, perhaps none have undergone a change as radical as that of gender and sex. This has given rise to a dire need for learning these vanishing boundaries as a part of accepting them. Accepting yourself, and those around you, as is, forms the crux of reevaluating how we, as individuals, define these terms and the roles and traits we assign to them. Learning 2.0 brings to the limelight people who, through their insights, guide the listeners on this path of relearning.</p>

    free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
    Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan, and Daniel Kahneman.<br /><br />The annual TED
    Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED’s media initiatives include TED.com, where
    new TED Talks are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as
    translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious Project
    that takes a collaborative approach to fund ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx,
    which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the
    TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their
